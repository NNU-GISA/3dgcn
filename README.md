## Introduction
Point clouds are among the popular geometry representations for 3D vision applications. However, without regular structures like 2D images, processing and summarizing information over these unordered data points are very challenging. Although a number of previous works attempt to analyze point clouds and achieve promising performances, their performances would degrade significantly when data variations like shift and scale changes are presented. To this end, we propose **3D Graph Convolution Networks (3D-GCN)**, which is designed to extract local 3D features from point clouds across scales, while shift and scale-invariance properties are introduced.
